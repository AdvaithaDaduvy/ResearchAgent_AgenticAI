data. However, the testing set is not representative of the overall data, so the performance
estimate may be biased.
3.7. Performance Metrics
To evaluate the machine learning models and analyze their performances, we consid-
ered some metrics such as the accuracy, recall, and area under the curve (AUC).
3.7.1. Accuracy
Accuracy measures the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of
samples. Applying Equation (1), we can calculate the accuracy.
Accuracy = (( TN+TP)/(TP+TN+FP+FN))☻100% (1)
where:
TP = True positive;
TN = True negative;
FN = False negative;
FP = False positive.
3.7.2. Recall
Recall is one of the another most important metrics to evaluate machine learning
model. The recall can be calculated as:
Recall =TP/(TP+FN) (2)
3.7.3. Area under the Curve
AUC stands for the area under the curve. The AUC evaluates how effectively the
model distinguishes between both positive and negative categories. Higher AUC values
indicate a better performance of the model.
4. Machine Learning Models
4.1. Transfer Learning Models
Transfer learning is a type of machine learning that is frequently employed with
previously trained neural networks [ 47–49]. For image categorization and detection, some
transfer learning models, including VGG16, ResNet-50, and Inception V3, are frequently
utilized [ 50,51]. Transfer learning methods have the greatest advantages in terms of cost
and time efﬁciency [ 52]. Instead of beginning from scratch, which takes more time and
requires the utilization of GPU resources and big image databases, the pre-trained models
are leveraged to transfer information and complete the task [53,54].
4.1.1. ResNet-50
The short form of the residual network is ResNet-50. ResNet-50 is an adaptation of the
ResNet architecture that has 50 deep layers and has been trained using at least one million
examples from the ImageNet database [ 55]. The ResNet-50 architecture comprises a series
of average pooling convolutional units [56].Algorithms 2023 ,16, 176 11 of 19
Although the residual network layer is connected to the layers further ahead, in typical
neural networks, each layer’s output is connected to the next input layer [ 57]. Figure 5
shows the residual block of the transfer learning model [ 58]. If there is a large amount
of data accessible and there are more layers and parameters, the accuracy will increase.
However, when the number of parameters or layers increases, issues such as vanishing
gradients start to occur. At this moment, residual networks operate more effectively and
provide good solutions. They might skip superﬂuous or unnecessary layers to achieve
greater accuracy. Using residual connections, some layers can be skipped. Skip-connections
can be placed between two or more layers [59–61].
Figure 5. Residual block.
4.1.2. VGG16
The VGG16 network structure was proposed by Zisserman and Simonyan in 2014,
which is one of the VGG-NET-based networks [ 62]. VGG16 is a deeper network for
detecting and classifying images, similar to AlexNet [ 62–64]. The ImageNet database can
be used to train VGG16 [ 65]. When recognizing and categorizing the images, the dataset
can be expressed with greater accuracy using VGG16 [ 66]. One beneﬁt of VGG16 is that it
performs better when dealing with vast amounts of data and in complex context recognition
tasks [ 67–69]. The VGG16 network includes 16 convolutional layers and a 3 by 3 receptive
ﬁeld. There are a total of 5 such layers, each with a size of 2 ☻2 (max-pooling layers). The
ﬁnal max-pooling layer is followed by 3 completely linked layers. The ReLU activation
function is utilized to activate the hidden layer in VGG16, and the ﬁnal layers use the
softmax classiﬁer [58]. Figure 6 shows the VGG16 architecture.Algorithms 2023 ,16, 176 12 of 19
Figure 6. Architecture of VGG16.
4.1.3. Inception V3
The Inception v3 model is a deep learning network model that is mostly used for image
categorization and detection [ 70–73]. The training of Inception V3 is difﬁcult with a low
computer conﬁguration; sometimes, it takes few days to train the model [ 71,74]. Compared
to Inception V1, which GoogLeNet released in2014, Inception V3 is an upgrade [ 75]. In
2015, Inception V3 was released with 42 layers and minimal error rates compared to its
predecessors. The steps of the Inception process are convolution, pooling, dropout, fully
connected, and softmax [76,77]. Figure 7 shows the architecture of Inception V3 [78].

5. Results’ Analysis and Discussion
The results of various types of developed deep learning models—i.e., the VGG16,
CNN, ResNet-50, and Inception V3 classiﬁcation algorithms—on the brain tumor MR image
dataset are analyzed in Table 3, and comparisons are shown in Figure 8. In Table 3, we
present the performance of the models with respect to the accuracy, area under the curve
(AUC), recall, and loss function results. After analyzing the methods of the CNN, VGG16,
ResNet-50, and Inception V3, it was observed that the CNN outperformed the other deep
learning models based on the ﬁndings in Table 1. The CNN achieved a validation accuracy
of 93.3%, a validation AUC of 98.43%, a validation recall of 91.1%, and a validation loss
of 0.260.

CNN 93.30 98.43 91.13 0.25
ResNet-50 81.10 94.20 81.04 0.85
VGG16 71.60 89.60 70.03 1.18
Inception V3 80.00 89.14 79.81 3.67
In Figure 9, the validation accuracy with respect to the training accuracy graphs for
the CNN, ResNet-50, Inception V3, and VGG16 are presented accordingly. The blue lines
present the training accuracy, and the orange lines present the validation accuracy. Here,
the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 93.30% with a training accuracy
value of 90.50%. ResNet-50 achieved a validation accuracy of 81.10% with the highest
training accuracy value of 98.43%. Inception V3 achieved a validation accuracy of 80% and
a training accuracy of 91.79%. However, VGG16 achieved the least validation accuracy
of 71.60% and the least training accuracy of 79.20%. While implementing the models, the
epochs were selected to be 80, and the batch size was selected to be 18 with the Adam
optimizer. According to the accuracy graph analysis, the CNN performed better than the
other models, because the validation accuracy had a great output curve with respect to the
training accuracy, and no over-ﬁtting or under-ﬁtting problems occurred.

1.Introduction
)e brain is a key organ responsible for the central nervous
system. )e human brain complements the central nervoussystem by connecting the bone marrow. )e brain has theresponsibility of controlling the actions of the human body.It receives the information from a diﬀerent sense and aftermaking decisions, sends the instructions to the body. )e
brain is the central part of the administration section of the
human body that is responsible for all the activities of thehuman body with the help of neurons.Malignant and benign are the currently prevalent types       
of signiﬁcant brain tumors. )e brain tumor is considereddeadly cancer in adults and children. A brain tumor occurswhen the brain tissues develop unnaturally. )e abnormaltissues overgrow compared to the healthy cells, causing themass of cells that eventually transform tumors [1].

Quick and timely recognition of a brain tumor is of the
utmost importance for curing the tumor. It depends on theexpertise and professional skills of the doctor and whichmethodisselectedtotreatthepatientforrapidrecovery.Itischallenging to determine the correct type of brain tumor inthe initial phase, yet vital as it helps the physicians treat thepatient accordingly [2].

To reduce the polyp mis-detection rate, “a computer-aided polyp detection system”should be used [3].
Brain tumors can be a major contributor to psychiatric
complications such as depression and panic attacks. Earlydetectionofbraintumorshasasigniﬁcantimpressiononthe
success of tumor treatment. Gliomas are signiﬁcant early
brain tumors with an extremely high mortality occurrenceratio. Gliomas can be classiﬁed as High-Grade Gliomas(HGG), which are inﬁltrated and more destructive, or Low-Grade Gliomas (LGG), which are of little harm. It is chal-lenging to detect the tumor because it can appear in anyshape, size, and location.        
Glioma is considered to be the more common type of
brain tumor. MRI scans generally segment glioma in ne-crotic tissue, active tumor, and surrounding edema (ED).Manually segmenting tumors are a slow and repetitive
procedure that requires the help of a human expert.
Computerized tools play an essential role in glioma seg-mentation.Gliomasegmentationalgorithmscanbetypicallydistributed into traditional Machine Learning and DeepLearningalgorithms.Accordingtoastudy,aDeepLearningAlgorithm (3D Dense UNet CNN) was proposed to classifythe output in the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), andenhancing tumor (ET) [4].
)e processing of medical images plays a key role in
assistinghumansinidentifyingdiﬀerentdiseases.Computertomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
are two approaches usually utilized for inspecting the ir-
regularities in brain tissues concerning the size, location, orshape of cells, which can help in detecting the tumor in itsinitial stages [5].
Robust machine learning systems enhance the accuracy

)is article proposes a new machine learning (ML)
model to overcome this precise segmentation of brain tu-mors. )e proposed intelligent detection model for identi-
fying brain tumors has been classiﬁed into four classes: no-
tumor, glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. A total of 3264images has been used in the model, including 926, 937, and901forglioma,meningioma,andpituitary,respectively,and500 for the no-tumor class.
Deep learning replicates the brain in data processing,
pattern recognition, and decision-making development.Deepneuralnetworkshavethecompetencyofunsupervisedlearning from unstructured data. Convolutional NeuralNetwork (CNN) works exceptionally well in deep learning,especiallyrecognitionandclassiﬁcationofimages,speech,or
text. Convolutional Network typically contains an inserting
layer, a resulting layer, and many undiscovered layers. Aseriesof convolutionallayersare linkedintheundiscoveredlayers. )e starting function comprises the RELU layer, andthe Final Convolution embroils the backpropagation [7].
2.Related Work
Salçin [8] proposed the mechanism to diagnose brain tu-mors in early stages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
images have been analyzed to detect the regions containing
tumors and classify these regions into diﬀerent tumor cat-egories.Deeplearningprovidesrelativelyeﬃcientresultsforimage classiﬁcation tasks. )erefore, the ConvolutionalNeural Networks method has been utilized and imple-mented via the TensorFlow library in this study.

plies a mathematical operation called convolution. Con-volutional Neural networks are limited, which utilizeconvolution in one of the multiple layers of the networkrather than the widely known multiplication matrix. CNNuses fewer parameters and connections than the conven-tional feedforward neural networks, making the trainingeasier.

# Agent: Scientific Summary Extractor
## Final Answer:
**Models:** The research paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor (HDL2BT) classiﬁcation model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  The paper also mentions and compares its results to other models in the related work section, including Faster R-CNN, 2D CNN, Cascade Deep Learning model, CNN-based multitask classiﬁcation, RELM (Regularized Extreme Learning Machine), nLBP and αLBP (Local Binary Pattern variations), MLP-IWOA (Multilayer Perceptron with Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm), BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine) with ANN (Artificial Neural Network), GA-SVM (Genetic Algorithm with SVM), and a Gaussian Mixture Model with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm combined with a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

**Methodologies:** The HDL2BT model consists of three main layers: data acquisition, preprocessing, and application (CNN-based classification). Data acquisition gathers MRI images. Preprocessing includes normalization and resizing. The CNN utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, with a ReLU layer for non-linearity. A Softmax function converts output into probabilities. Backpropagation is used for training. The methodology involves a training phase (87% of data) and a validation phase (13% of data).  Accuracy and miss rate are used as performance metrics.

**Results:** The proposed HDL2BT model achieved 92.13% accuracy and a 7.87% miss rate in the validation phase.  This is compared to other models in the literature review, which show lower accuracy rates.  The training phase achieved 94.84% accuracy and a 5.16% miss rate.  The results are presented in tables and figures showing precision and miss rate for each tumor type (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) in both training and validation phases.  A comparison chart shows the proposed model's improved accuracy compared to those of Salçin (91.66%), Sarkar et al. (91.3%), Kokila et al. (92.00%), and Ranjbarzadeh et al. (92.03%).

**Results:** The proposed HDL2BT model achieved 92.13% accuracy and a 7.87% miss rate in the validation phase.  This is compared to other models in the literature review, which show lower accuracy rates.  The training phase achieved 94.84% accuracy and a 5.16% miss rate.  The results are presented in tables and figures showing precision and miss rate for each tumor type (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) in both training and validation phases.  A comparison chart shows the proposed model's improved accuracy compared to those of Salçin (91.66%), Sarkar et al. (91.3%), Kokila et al. (92.00%), and Ranjbarzadeh et al. (92.03%).

**Performance Pattern Report: Brain Tumor Classification Models**

This report analyzes the performance of various machine learning models for brain tumor classification, based on the provided research paper summary.  The analysis focuses on identifying performance patterns based on model type, methodology, and dataset characteristics.

**I. Model Performance:**

The summarized research highlights a clear trend favoring deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed Hierarchical Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor (HDL2BT) model, a CNN-based architecture, achieved a validation accuracy of 92.13%, outperforming several other models mentioned in the literature review.  These models included:

* **Traditional Machine Learning Models:**  Support Vector Machines (SVM), both standalone and combined with Genetic Algorithms (GA-SVM),  Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) with Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA), and Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) showed lower accuracy than the HDL2BT and other CNN-based models. This suggests that the complex feature extraction capabilities of CNNs are better suited to the high dimensionality and nuanced patterns within medical imaging data compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

* **Other CNN-based Models:**  The HDL2BT model also outperformed other reported CNN models (e.g., Faster R-CNN, 2D CNN, Cascade Deep Learning model, CNN-based multitask classification), although the exact details of these models' architectures and training methodologies are not fully described, limiting direct comparison.  It outperformed specific models cited in the literature review: Salçin (91.66%), Sarkar et al. (91.3%), Kokila et al. (92.00%), and Ranjbarzadeh et al. (92.03%). This suggests that the hierarchical architecture of HDL2BT or other architectural choices contribute to its enhanced performance.

* **Hybrid Models:** The inclusion of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) combined with a CNN suggests that hybrid approaches can be explored. However, no performance figures are provided for this specific hybrid model in the summary.


**II. Methodological Factors:**

The HDL2BT model's success can be partially attributed to its methodology.  Key factors include:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization and resizing of MRI images are crucial steps in improving model performance and reducing variability due to differences in image acquisition protocols.

* **Deep Learning Architecture:** The hierarchical three-layer structure of HDL2BT (data acquisition, preprocessing, and CNN classification) allowed efficient feature extraction and classification.  The use of convolutional and pooling layers within the CNN effectively captures spatial hierarchies in the image data.

* **Training Methodology:** The use of a large training dataset (87% of available data) is a significant factor contributing to the high accuracy.  The validation set (13% of data) provided an unbiased estimate of model generalization.

* **Performance Metrics:** The use of both accuracy and miss rate provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including both correct classifications and misclassifications.

**III. Performance Trends and Conditions:**

Based on the limited data, several trends emerge:

* **Deep learning models (CNNs) outperform traditional machine learning models** for brain tumor classification in this specific context.

* **Larger training datasets and appropriate data preprocessing are essential** for achieving high accuracy.

* **Hierarchical architectures within deep learning models might offer performance advantages.**

* **Model comparison is hampered by a lack of consistent reporting of methods and dataset details.**  A more comprehensive analysis would benefit from a standardized comparison across models with identical datasets and evaluation metrics.

**IV. Conclusion:**

The HDL2BT model demonstrates the potential of CNN-based deep learning approaches for accurate brain tumor classification. However, the relative contributions of different architectural and methodological choices to its success require further investigation.  More rigorous comparative studies using standardized datasets and evaluation protocols are needed to better understand the generalizability of these findings.
